# BlackRaven Dojo (v2, 2020)

The BlackRaven Dojo is a course in Software Engineering fundamentals comprising of 2 levels - basic training, and the professional course modules. The course is designed for all levels of experience, and assumes no previous knowledge of programming. The objectives of the course are:

* To teach fundamental machine architecture
* To fill the gaps in understanding from high-level-first programming courses by teaching from a machine-level perspective
* To abstract the concept of specific programming languages to general principles 
* To teach and develop research skills

## Costs

The course is offered at NZD $100 per student per session. A maximum of two merit (scholarship) places will be offered at each session, these students will be welcome at no charge. Selection of merit students shall be at the discretion of the tutors, and their decision is final.

Class size maximum 10. Runs continuously throughout the year, beginning every 6 weeks. The classroom time is 1hr/week, with additonal assignments. 

* Binary, Hexadecimal, Boolean logic, Logic Gates
* CPU conceptual architecture, Memory Architecture, Von Neumann vs. Harvard architecture
* Gate networks, Binary Arithmetic using gates, 8/16/32/64 bit architectures, Introduction to Opcodes & Assembler
* Primitives & ADTs, structs, pointers, arrays/maps as abstract concepts, Linked Lists, Binary Trees
* Stacks, Flow Control & Branching: Conditionals, Loops, Subroutines, Lexical Scope
* The C Language as portable assembly. Basic Compiler concepts, recursive Functions
* Introduction to high-level languages and species identification. 

### Course - "We're always beginners"

No maximum class size. Class runs Jan-Nov, any student who has completed Basic can join at any time.
