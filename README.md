# BlackRaven Dojo

The BlackRaven Dojo is a course in Software Engineering fundamentals comprising of 48 sessions (8 Units of 6 sessions each). The course is designed for all levels of experience, and assumes no previous knowledge of programming. The objectives of the course are:

* To teach fundamental machine architecture
* To fill the gaps in understanding from high-level-first programming courses by teaching from a machine-level perspective
* To abstract the concept of specific programming languages to general principles 
* To teach and develop research skills

## Structure

The course is comprised of 8 units of 6 sessions small group tuition, which will not exceed 6 students. Each unit runs for 6 weeks. Exercises and tasks will be set at the end of each session, reasonable extra one-to-one tuition and mentoring is available from tutors as part of the course structure. Guest lectures are included in cost and are optional, but highly recommended. Recommended further study and reading lists will be provided and are also optional, but highly recommended.

History & Culture segements will be explored informally either aside the course materials or outside of tuition time.

## Evaluation

BlackRaven Dojo is a professional development course, and does not include exams, offer certification, trophies, letters after your name, ranks, badges, brands or tattoos on completion. As a paid course, it is the in the interests of students to take as much as possible from the content, mentoring and tuition provided.

## Costs

The course is offered at NZD $100 per student per session. A maximum of two merit (scholarship) places will be offered at each session, these students will be welcome at no charge. Selection of merit students shall be at the discretion of the tutors, and their decision is final.
