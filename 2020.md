# BlackRaven Dojo 2020

The Proposed changes for BR Dojo in 2020. The main intent is to separate out the basics as a seperate prelimiary course, and make the main course non-linear, i.e. someone who completes basic can join the main course immediately during any module, and graduates a year later when they have completed the rest of the modules and the course has cycled back to the module they originally joined. 

## Structure

### Basic - "There's No Magic"

Class size maximum 10. Runs continuously throughout the year (1hr/week) with assignment. 

* Binary, Hexadecimal, Boolean logic, Logic Gates
* CPU conceptual architecture, Memory Architecture, Von Neumann vs. Harvard architecture
* Gate networks, Binary Arithmetic using gates, 8/16/32/64 bit architectures, Introduction to Opcodes & Assembler
* Primitives & ADTs, structs, pointers, arrays/maps as abstract concepts, Linked Lists, Binary Trees
* Stacks, Flow Control & Branching: Conditionals, Loops, Subroutines, Lexical Scope
* The C Language as portable assembly. Basic Compiler concepts, recursive Functions
